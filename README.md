## 📖 Short description:<br>
Two bash scripts that pack file or folder larger than 100MB by compressing and splitting content into 100MB files, 
bypassing the explicit need of Github LFS usage.<br>
If you want to retrieve content, just reverse the process with the `unpack` script.
## 👨‍💻 Usage snippets:
  To pack before pushing to the repo:
```bash
pack name_of_file_or_folder
```
  To unpack after pulling from the repo:
```bash
unpack name_of_file_or_folder
```
